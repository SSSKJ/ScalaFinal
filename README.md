# ScalaFinal is the whole Finder for Scala Final Project
the Streaming Finder is the main Finder that stores the codes for project.
Since the conflicts of version, the ScalaTest File UnitTest for functions cannot be ran in the Streaming. So we move the ScalaTest file UnitTest to 
a new Finder named Tests.
